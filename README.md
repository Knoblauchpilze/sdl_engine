# sdl_engine

A simple, almighty and perfect SDL engine. Or at least that's how I would sell it.

Contains a wrapper around SDL calls so that we can easily switch to another rendering engine if needed.

# Installation

- Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:Knoblauchpilze/sdl_engine.git`
- Go to the project's directory `cd ~/path/to/the/repo`
- Compile: `make r`
- Install: `make install`

# Usage

Don't forget to add `/usr/local/lib` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to be able to load shared libraries at runtime.
